</h2>

SwiftBlocksUI is a way to write interactive Slack messages and modal dialogs
(also known as Slack "applications")
using a SwiftUI like declarative style.

This repository contains the SlashCows demo,
a Slack slash command that produces ASCII Cows. Moo!

## How to Run

If [swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh) is installed,

a simple `./Sources/SlashCows/main.swift` does the job.

Alternatively: `swift run`:
```bash
helge@Zini18 SlashCows (main)*$ swift run
2020-07-17T17:05:33+0200 notice Î¼.console : App started on port: 1337
```

## How to Build

```bash
cd SlashCows
swift build
```


## Environment Variables

- `SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` (shared secret with Slack to verify requests)
- `PORT` (the port the app is going to start on, defaults to 1337)

## Requirements

On Linux this currently requires a Swift 5.3 environment
(swiftc crash, might be [SR-12543](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12543)).

On macOS it should work with Swift 5.2 (aka Xcode 11) and up,
though 5.3 has some additional conveniences.
